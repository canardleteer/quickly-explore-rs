# Introduction

I wrote this as a quick guide for folks who are choosing to, or being asked to:

- Work with Rust repositories.
- Align development practices around Rust repositories.
- In some way incorporate Rust in their day to day development considerations.

There is no expectation that you "want" to do any of this, and it's not my goal
to make you want to.

The goal here, is to provide a quick tour of what exists in the Rust Ecosystem.
**I am not intending to teach people how to write Rust.** Where possible, I do
point to far better resources on that subject than I would be able to write.

The Rust ecosystem has been good to me, and I recommend you give it a shot.
