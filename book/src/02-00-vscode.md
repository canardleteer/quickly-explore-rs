# VSCode

If you open this repository in VSCode, you will probably want to install the following Extensions:

- [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
- [CodeLLDB](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb)
- [Even Better TOML / Taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo)

And possibly whatever else comes recommended.

VSCode is fairly common as a Rust IDE, but you are of course welcome to choose
whatever you like...

## If you don't want to use VSCode

I fully support this decision.

I hear the `emacs` experience is great!

I caution you, that as far as I know, neither Rust Rover, nor Sublime implement
the [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) out of the box. You
**definitely** want to be setup with it for a smooth "start learning" experience.

- It is up to you, if learning how to add LSP support to the IDE of your own
  choosing, for a language you're just learning, is something you want to do
  right now.
