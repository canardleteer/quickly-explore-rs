# VSCode

If you open this repository in VSCode, you will probably want to install the following Extensions:

- [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
- [CodeLLDB](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb)
- [Even Better TOML / Taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo)

And possibly whatever else comes recommended.

VSCode is fairly common as a Rust IDE, but you are of course welcome to choose whatever you like.
