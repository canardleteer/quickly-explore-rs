# Clean up whatever changes you made (if any)

You can do some quick formatting and linting stuff:

```text
# will automatically clean up your code, where it can
cargo fmt

# will helpfully bark at you as you learn Rust patterns
cargo clippy
```

These are useful as pipeline steps for code hygiene verification, but also **EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR LEARNING AS YOU GO.**

Neither step above should make any changes on this default repo. It's just good to know they are there and work.
