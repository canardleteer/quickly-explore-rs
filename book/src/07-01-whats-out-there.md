# What's out there?

*Caveat:* **This list is generally oriented for a Service Engineer migrating to Rust.**

- CLI Arg parsing: [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap)
- Serialization / Deserialization: [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde)
- [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) is a curated list of useful packages.
- Asyncronous Rust: [async-book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/)
  - I mostly use [tokio](https://tokio.rs/), but there is more than one `async` runtime available.
    - Even for microcontrollers, [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) is an example.
  - gRPC Services/Clients: [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) (with [prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) for protobuf)
  - REST Services: [hyper](https://hyper.rs/)... Likley something built on top of `hyper`.
  - HTTP Service Calls: [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest), but likley a client autogenerated via an OpenAPI package (there are a few).
  - ["Are we web yet?"](https://www.arewewebyet.org/) is a website that generally contains a curated list of traditional service packages.
    - I personally don't use this list much, but it's useful to see what's out there.
  - [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) is a good thing to know about, if you use `tokio`.

- Kubernetes:
  - Kubernetes management (from Deployment, through Operators & Controllers to Schedulers): [kube.rs](https://kube.rs/)

- Tracing / Logging
  - Start by learning the [log](https://github.com/rust-lang/log) package with `env_logger`.
  - Then learn about Tokio's [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) package.
    - Then, like myself, patiently await `tracing v0.2.x`
    - Once you learn how Context propagation works in Rust, `tracing` can be hooked into observability stacks via layering, but it's worth learning `tracing` for just `async` Rust first.
