# Conclusion

Hopefully, you've somewhat learned how to:

- Can build most Rust repositories from source.
- Generally know how to interact with plain Rust codebases.
- Are not afraid of what's going on in a Rust repository.
- Know, in general, where to find packages, and can loosely equate them to
  another language's packages.
- Know what kind of build / testing / dependency tooling is available out of
  the box.
- Are curious maybe? Looking to go back and learn more about some of the
  features skimmed over?
